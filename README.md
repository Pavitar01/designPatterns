## Introduction

React.js has gained immense popularity for building user interfaces. To create scalable and maintainable applications, it's crucial to employ effective design patterns. This repository explores various design patterns in React.js, providing insights into when and how to use them.

## Why Design Patterns in React?

Design patterns offer proven solutions to common problems in software development. In the context of React.js, design patterns help streamline code, enhance readability, and ensure a consistent structure across projects. By understanding and applying these patterns, developers can build robust and maintainable React applications.

## Available Design Patterns

### 1. Component Patterns

Explore different ways to structure React components, such as presentational components, container components, and the component composition pattern.

### 2. State Management Patterns

Learn about state management patterns, including local component state, context API, and state management libraries like Redux.

### 3. Render Props Pattern

Understand the render props pattern as a technique for component composition, allowing the sharing of code between components.

### 4. Higher-Order Component (HOC) Pattern

Delve into the Higher-Order Component pattern for reusing component logic and enhancing component behavior.

### 5. Container Component Pattern

Discover the Container Component pattern for separating concerns between presentational and container components.

### 6. Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components

Differentiate between controlled and uncontrolled components and understand the trade-offs associated with each approach.

### 7. Hooks Patterns

Explore various patterns when using React Hooks for managing state and side effects in functional components.
